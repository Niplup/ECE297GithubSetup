# ECE297GithubSetup
Two simple shell scripts to help you setup a Github repo for the ECE297 project. I take zero blame if this destroys your repository, I've barely tested it and these are only designed to work on the UG machines.

For the step where you have to add the SSH key to Github follow the steps below. Click on settings.
